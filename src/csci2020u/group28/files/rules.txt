2 - You are X and the computer is O. Players take turn putting their marks in empty squares.
3 - The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
4 - When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row by then, the game ends in a tie.

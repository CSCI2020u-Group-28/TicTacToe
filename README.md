This is a Tic Tac Toe game that can be run on a server. Players take turn putting their marks in empty squares of a 3x3 grid. Whoever gets 3 in a row horiziontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If no one is able to win after the grid is full, the game ends in a tie.

Upon running the program, a window pops up with 4 buttons. They are Play Game, How to Play, Credit, and Exit. Clicking Play Game prompts you to enter a port number to connect to for the server. There is also a Back to Main Menu button available at the top. How to Play displays rules.txt, showing the user how the game works. Credit displays credit.txt, showing the names of the members of the group. Exit closes the pop-up window.

The code is developed by Group 28 for the class CSCI2020U: Software Systems Development and Integration.

## How to run

2.  Clone the repository using git clone
3. Click the run button or compile the code in your cmd line/terminal
4. Wait for someone else to connect to the same server
5. Take turns placing marks on the grid until someone wins, a tie, or someone disconnects
